Whenever a function requests a string (text) standard Python strings can be used.  If you
wish to format the strings with color and formatting codes, you can use the constants in
ms3.formattingCodes.  The constants are simply the ampersand character (&), followed by a
single letter/number.  You can directly type of the formatting codes if you with within
the strings like so.

print "&4Hello World" # Prints our red text saying "Hello World"

If you wish to print out the ampersand (&) directly you must prefix it with a backslash,
like a Python escape character

print "/&4Hello World" # Prints out "&4Hello World"

Users of Bukkit servers should find these formatting codes familiar.
See https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes for more on formatting codes.

The Python escape characters function as normal with the following exception(s) with
printing to the in-game Minecraft chat via the print keyword and other functions.

\t (Tab) will always print 4 spaces.
