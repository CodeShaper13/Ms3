Ms3 is a Minecraft Forge Mod that aims to provide a means for users to write their own, version independent scripts that interact with both Minecraft and their operating system. There are version independent from Ms3, Minecraft Forge, and Minecraft itself. Upon updating any of the preceding, there will be no need for the user to edit any of their scripts.
